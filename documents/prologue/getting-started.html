        <li>This document is made by lx-r in July 29, 2014</li>    
        <li>I decided to change "Computer Science" to "Computing" since I plan to learn using computers with topics coming from not just
        from Computer Science but a lot more.</li>

    <h2>Entry</h2>
    <p>As a kinesthetic learner -- a learner who learns more by doing, the only way I can learn and do my goals are doing it.</p>

    <p>In mathematics, I got started in arithmetic. I watched Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ma004">Intro to Algebra 
    Review</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ma008">College Algebra</a>'s first part of the lesson and answered the 
    exercises. It's focused on numbers, operators and properties (associative and commutative).</p>
    
    <p>In Computing, I plan to get started in the C programming language with the ANSI standard. I found a book called "The C Programming 
    Language (Second Edition) [ANSI C]", a book written by its creators -- Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kerningham.</p>
        
    <p>I haven't got started in Science and the English Language but I haven't found a course for the English Language but found a course 
    called <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ph100">"Intro to Physics" for Science</a>.</p>
    
    <p>As for being physically fit, I am to exercise with intervals incrementing by one each period.</p>
    
    <p>You might think that this is too much for me but as I said, it doesn't have a time limit. There is an idiom that motivates me from 
    doing these which is: </p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p align="center">"Jack of all trades, master of <em>some</em>,<br /> Better than Jack of one trade, master of one."</p>
    </blockquote><hr />
