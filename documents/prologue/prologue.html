    <h2>Notes</h2>
    
    <ul>
    
    <li>While this is a document, this will also serve as a template to future documents until I decided to change the content. The CSS 
    stylesheet and the HTML structure is different from the pages that are part of the website because the stylesheet will cause 
    conflicts to my documents.</li>
    
    <li>The documents I'll write requires audiences who are familiar to what I am doing so this section is where I'll provide references 
    and resources.</li>
    
    <li>The "Entry" section is where the actual document is written.</li>
    
    <li><a href="">Eric S. Raymond's website (~esr)</a></li>

    <li>This document is made by lx-r in July 29, 2014</li>

    <h2>Entry</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the prologue section of the documents, this is where everything that I am involved with begins.</p>

    <p>Let me start with this document and the documents to be written in the future. Followed by the design of this website and it's 
    purpose. Finishing with introducting the lx-f persona and my goals.
    
    <p>This document will not be like the future documents because this serves as something like a "readme" and will be a guide for the 
    future documents. The future documents will be told in a way that it's a "self vs. self" with a first-person perspective while 
    talking to you, the audience of this site.</p>
    
    <p>Let's talk about the design of the website. I admit that this website is not beautiful but I won't call it ugly because while I
    plan to make the design plain, I'll make sure that the designs match well. The designs are not original, I admit! They're from
    Eric S. Raymond's website, I used <em>some</em> of his designs because I don't have good tastes in design, I don't have enough time
    for design and we all have different tastes in design. This website isn't about design, it's about what I am doing, what I intend to 
    do and what I did to accomplish/fail that activity. </p>
    
    <p>For the purpose of the website, I made a website because</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I want to share my knowledge to everyone who's interested;</li>
        <li>I am a kinesthetic learner and I believe that if I want to improve my grammatical skills, I'll make a document and correct
        my wrong grammars if there are;</li>
        <li>If someone wants to know about me, I'd refer them here and let them know who I really am;</li>
        <li>I feel proud when I see my accomplishments and I'll know my mistakes then improve more; and</li>
        <li>there's a chance that I'll need to use the contents for reference.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Who is lx-f? It's my alias because my real name is too long to write and I wanted to save time. There isn't a different between
    my real identity and lx-f, it's just that I mostly use lx-f as a name because it's shorter and easier to type but you'll find in the
    in the "About page" that it shows my full name.</p>
    
    <h3>Life goal: "Become the person who I wanted to be" explanation</h3>
    <p>Finally my goals, when I was younger, I didn't pay attention to class, I managed to get a passing score but never a high one, I
    am often bullied by my classmates. I have unnecessary mannerisms and attitudes that causes me to fail what I wanted to 
    do, so I wanted to change myself -- which is the purpose of writing documents. I have three types of goals: "The Mental Goal", 
    "The Physical Goal" and "The Social Goal". These goals are 3 parts of my life goal -- which is to "become the person who I wanted to 
    be". I'd have more goals but they're already part of these three goals.</p>
    
    <p>For the "Mental Goal", I need to learn the fundamentals of the subjects:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The English Language - I need to become excellent at reading and writing;</li>
        <li>Mathematics - Pretty much all the fundamental subjects not exceeding calculus;</li>
        <li>Science - Integrated Science, Biology, Chemistry and Physics fundamentals;</li>
        <li>Computer Science - It's for applying the first three to create wonderful programs; and</li>
        <li>subjects that are complementary to these three.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>For the "Physical Goal", I just need to become physically fit but it's easier said than done since I don't have much time for 
    this goal unlike the "Mental Goal". All I can do is to exericse by doing push-ups and situps with the interval of 1 every day.</p>
    
    <p>Like the "Physical Goal", I don't have enough time to do the "Social Goal". But I plan to play minecraft in my break to 
    communicate with others. This wraps up the prologue document.</p><hr />
