    <p>Welcome to the Home section of my website! It's the center where you can find information about me, what I am doing and what I 
    did to succeed what I am working on. Because of the contents like documents, projects and accomplishments which are not for 
    <em>everyone</em>, the user-friendliness of this website is complex but I made sure that the navigation is direct to the point.</p>
    
    <p>Most of the style of the website is inspired by <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/">~esr's website</a>, I used <em>some</em> of his
    designs because it's plain and simple. I liked how the designs were light on graphics without making the site
    <a href="http://catb.org/esr/html-hell.html">ugly as hell</a>.</p>
